# This test is used to verify the specific heat and thermal conductivity
# defined in ThermalUC as a function of temperature and porosity.
#
# The mesh is a 1x1x1 cube (single element).
# The temperature is ramped on all faces of the cube from 500 K to 1500K.
# The porosity is ramped on all faces of cube from 0.05 to 0.3
# Thermal conductivity and specific heat is computed using ThermalUC
# material model.
#
# The thermal conductivity and specific heat computed by BISON was picked
# up each 10 time steps for each block, and compared with analytical solution
# The results are the following:
#
#                    th conductivity [W/m/K]  Specific heat [J/kg/K]
#Temp [K]  Porosity  BUCK    Analytical       BUCK     Analytical
